The Virtual Painter project is an interactive application that allows users to paint on a virtual canvas using hand gestures. It integrates OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand tracking, enabling real-time detection and tracking of hand movements. Users can select different colors and brush sizes by performing specific gestures recognized by the system. As the user moves their hand in front of the camera, the system interprets these gestures and translates them into drawing actions on the virtual canvas. This project offers an engaging and intuitive way for users to create digital artwork without the need for physical drawing tools.
